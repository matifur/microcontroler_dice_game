# microcontroler_dice_game

The aim of the project is to build and program the FRDM-KL05Z system to support the gameplay. Device allows you to throw the dice 3 times, the player can make the last 2 throws
choose which dice he wants to roll. The program loops its operation, which means that when you play the game with more players, there is no need to restart the device, you can go directly to the new one
gameplay. Players operate the devices using the S1-S4 buttons and the throw results are displayed on the LCD Display.

Detailed documentation is available in this repository.
